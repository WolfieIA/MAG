## main points
- dream about gertrude robinson
- first dream
	- standing atop the very peak of Canary Wharf, overlooking Barclays building
	- feel pulsing beat of light that stands atop the tower
	- thrummed through me
	- see the glow pass across his skin like oil
	- the city below him was dark, lit by sickly orange glow of streetlamps
	- web of dark tendrils crisscrossing the streets and crawling up buildings
	- blood vessels, thick and dark, all throbbed in time with the beat of light
	- he fell, and hit the ground, dream-pain
	- explored the city
		- there were people, not moving, just6 there
		- looked like photographs, overexposed and washed out, caught and immortalized in single instant
		- each had tendrils wrapped around
		- the face of every person was surprise, pain and terrified confusion
	- wandered to barclays building
		- lights were on, orange lights
		- no people
		- something in the small office next to her old desk
		- [[john uzel]], her old manager was suspended two feet from the floor
	- awoke, end of dream.

- was offered to return to Barclays, but declined the offer
- found out what happened to [[john uzel]], he hung himself (dream mirrored it)

- same dream the following saturday, but with different people
	- the old people were faded, and john was faded too
	-
