## main points
- dream about gertrude robinson
- first dream
	- standing atop the very peak of Canary Wharf, overlooking Barclays building
	- feel pulsing beat of light that stands atop the tower
	- thrummed through me
	- see the glow pass across his skin like oil
	- the city below him was dark, lit by sickly orange glow of streetlamps
	- web of dark tendrils crisscrossing the streets and crawling up buildings
	- blood vessels, thick and dark, all throbbed in time with the beat of light
	- he fell, and hit the ground, dream-pain
	- explored the city
		- there were people, not moving, just6 there
		- looked like photographs, overexposed and washed out, caught and immortalized in single instant
		- each had tendrils wrapped around
		- the face of every person was surprise, pain and terrified confusion
	- wandered to barclays building
		- lights were on, orange lights
		- no people
		- something in the small office next to her old desk
		- [[john uzel]], her old manager was suspended two feet from the floor
	- awoke, end of dream.

- was offered to return to Barclays, but declined the offer
- found out what happened to [[john uzel]], he hung himself (dream mirrored it)

- same dream the following saturday, but with different people
	- the old people were faded, and john was faded too
	- see the deaths via the vines

- regular part of his sleeping for 8 years
- he saw his father in his dream, walking down Oxford Street, with veins climbing up his leg and into his chest
- his father died in 10 days, heart attack (new year's eve)
- took a month and half for father's image to fade, but image appeared 10 days before his death

### the dream on the last night
- dull orange glow seemed muffled
- something was wrong
- veins thickened, and seemed to cover almost the whole space of every street
- there would be dark red light travelling inside of them
	- illuminate faces and shadows within tendrils
- decided to follow the red light
- went towards vauxhall and the thames
- bridge was knotted high with flashing vines
- destination was a small building, standing alone the other side of the bridge near the enbankment
- read: the magnus institute, founded 1818
- entered, not sure how
- veins blocked every entrance entirely, but he moved through
- it led to a room, called archive
- shelves coated in sticky black tar, thickened, pulpy blood that pumped through each and every one of those veins
- he saw gertrude getting wrapped around tightly, and saw the expression was more fearful than any he saw

### notes from archivist
- elias was vague to what happened to gertrude robinson
- "died in the line of duty"
- [[antonio blake]] is a fake name, like it's a joke.
- rosie might be recording some too
- not sure if gertrude got the chance of reading this statement
