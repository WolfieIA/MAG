	- woman ran, and trevor set him on fire

- according to trevor's observations on vampires
		- more like an animal than a man
		- they do not speak, having no need for air and no room for a windpipe.
		- can go out in sunlight, they just avoid direct sunlight
		- don't reproduce by feeding, not sure how

- notes from archivist
	- trevor went to the break room to sleep, and didnt wake up from lung cancer
	- news reports support the events
	- small bag of shark teeth, but didnt match any currently known species
