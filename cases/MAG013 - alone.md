witness: "[[naomi herne]]"

## main points
- the previous recording was corrupted, not salvageable.
- she was not sure what happened, and sheâ€™s thinking of backing out.
- she rather not to be alone
- person who worried about her is [[pastor david]]
	- not natural to live alone in isolation
	- creatures of community by nature
	- he was worried that naomi would get lost
- afterwards, got a job as a science technician
- interviewing for jobs, and met [[evan lukas]], her fiance
	- both of them were interviewing for lab assistant in one of the UCL biochem departments
	- he got the job, but she was happy
- they went out, lived together
- she very happy, and proposed
- 2015, evan dies, congenital heart disease.
- she had no friends to talk about this too
- no memory of week between death and funeral
- she went to a house in Kent, address probably from someone in evan's family
- evan was not on good terms with family, cause they were very religious
- never met or visited them, but she must have been known to be invited.
    - something about this is fishy...
- family was very rich
- moorland house
    - house was very large and old
    - high gate separating it from main road
    - trees were bending ominously when she parked
    - there's a mausoleum, last resting place
- evan's father looked like evan without joy and affection
    - only words were "my son is in there. he is dead"
- all of the relatives had the same expression as the father, eyes full of something dark
- they did not speak, it was very silent
- evan's face had no peace, it was hard and full of reproach like the family faces
- an old man told her to leave, because the burial is a family affair
- she drives off, and gets into a car crash
- wakes up in a field, at 11:12pm
    - cannot call, no service
    - heavy rain, soaked through her bag and spoilt her phone
    - she keeps walking, finds nothing but darkness
- rain stopped, and the fog was following her
- felt malicious, made her feel forsaken
- she started running, and ran to a grass area (strayed off the road)
- the ground was not wet, but it was damp from the mist
