## main points
- during 23rd december, 2 days before christmas
- not as bad of a night
- half-past one, they get a radio saying they have a pair of severe burn victims brought in
- when she arrived, she say a doctor assessing his burns, [[kayleigh grice]]
- kayleigh was very soft, but she gave out instructions to people
- first victim
	- these burns were second-degree, and covered the entire body
	- anything hot should have damaged the clothing, or melted on the skin, but it was unharmed
	- tall man, heavy-set
	- no screams, no cries, no moaning in pain
	- he was sleeping peacefully apparently
	- hair none, might be burned off
- second victim (younger)
	- almost identical shape, except burns stopped at neck
	- it was like he was wearing a choker
	- smaller than the first man, and younger
	- clean-shaven, long hair dyed completely black
	- there were second-degree burns, but there were small eyes tattooed on every one of his joints and on his heart
	- the tattoos were unblemished, and wasn't affected
- there was a blaze in a building site near st mary's churchyar
- no fire there, but there were burn marks and metal bar that bent
- older one had nothing, younger one had zippo lighter with an eye design and a password identifying him as [[gerard keay]]
- they treated them, and moved them to another room
- after an hour plus, the older victim bed made noises
	- he was saying something
	- it was very quiet, but it was the same words repeateed
	- not in english
	- "Asag, veepalach, the lightless flame."
	- eyes still closed, lips not barely moving
	-
