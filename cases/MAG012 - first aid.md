## main points
- during 23rd december 2011, 2 days before christmas
- not as bad of a night
- half-past one, they get a radio saying they have a pair of severe burn victims brought in
- when she arrived, she say a doctor assessing his burns, [[kayleigh grice]]
- kayleigh was very soft, but she gave out instructions to people
- first victim
	- these burns were second-degree, and covered the entire body
	- anything hot should have damaged the clothing, or melted on the skin, but it was unharmed
	- tall man, heavy-set
	- no screams, no cries, no moaning in pain
	- he was sleeping peacefully apparently
	- hair none, might be burned off
- second victim (younger)
	- almost identical shape, except burns stopped at neck
	- it was like he was wearing a choker
	- smaller than the first man, and younger
	- clean-shaven, long hair dyed completely black
	- there were second-degree burns, but there were small eyes tattooed on every one of his joints and on his heart
	- the tattoos were unblemished, and wasn't affected
- there was a blaze in a building site near st mary's churchyar
- no fire there, but there were burn marks and metal bar that bent
- older one had nothing, younger one had zippo lighter with an eye design and a password identifying him as [[gerard keay]]
- they treated them, and moved them to another room
- after an hour plus, the older victim bed made noises
	- he was saying something
	- it was very quiet, but it was the same words repeateed
	- not in english
	- "Asag, veepalach, the lightless flame."
	- eyes still closed, lips not barely moving
- at 3am
	- reception was empty, which is weird
	- waiting room should have been full, but it's deserted
	- everyone was essentially missing
- when she returned to waiting room for 3rd time
	- she heard growling of an animal
	- floor was shaking
	- vending machines were shaking violently and drinks exploded
	- the handle was very hot, cannot get out through door
- she walk past the man, and hear the chanting get louder
	- eyes were open, bloodshot
- she was gonna close his mouth, and gerard grabs her by the wrist
- his grip was very strong, and there was heat like his skin was still burning
- he was trying to protect her, touching the man was a bad idea
- gerard was looking for a small book bound in red leather, and a brass pendant that he was wearing
	- none came in
- he went to grab a sterile scalpel from the supply cupboard
- "Yes. For you, better beholding than the lightless flame." -gerard keay
- he took the scalpel, muttered some words, and put it in his throat
- smell of rotten meat and sizzling sound
- flesh blackened and cracked, bandages curled, and body cremated itself to ash
- gerard keay was treated for a further four days, before being discharged into care of his mother.
	- his mother is... dead?
	- someone else came to pick him up? maybe gertrude? they both seem interested in the [[jurgen leitner]] books?
- she gets the feeling that she's being watched when she's alone.

- notes from archivist
	- asag is the name of a demon, sumerian mythology, related to disease and corruption
	- asag was able to boil fish alive in their rivers
	- veepalach could be wypalac, meaning cauterize or brand
	- gerard keay's second time, check [[MAG004 - pageturner]]
	- hospital cctv footage had issues
		- at 03:11:22, everyone in the room stood up and calmly exited the doors. 
		- everyone only returns at 03:27:12, over 15 minutes later
		- at 03:22:52, feed cuts out, and is replaced with a close-up of a human eye, staring back
